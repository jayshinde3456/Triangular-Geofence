# Triangular Geofence (CKKS-based)

This repository contains the implementation of a privacy-preserving triangular geofencing system using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme.  
It was developed as part of my MSc Dissertation (2025).  

## Features
- Triangular geofence evaluation using barycentric coordinates.  
- Fully encrypted computations using CKKS (no raw GPS data exposed).  
- Performance analysis including accuracy, runtime, scalability, and security overhead.
